All the AForge.NET framework’s unit tests are based on NUnit test framework:
http://nunit.org/



How to run unit tests:
1) Download and install NUnit.

2) Build AForge.NET framework (use "Build All.sln" solution file from "Sources" folder),
   so you have "Release" folder with all framework’s assemblies. Note: this step can be
   skipped if you installed the framework from installation package, since framework’s
   built is provided with installation.

3) Build unit tests (use "Unit Tests\Build All Tests.sln" solution file), so you have
   "Unit Tests\Build" folder with tests’ assemblies.

4) Run NUNit UI application and open "All Tests.nunit" project. Use "Run" button to run
   all unit tests.



NOTE: Provided unit tests do not cover entire AForge.NET framework so far.
